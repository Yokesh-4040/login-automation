## Top Priority

1. Robust Login Result Detection
   - Detect if, after login attempt, the browser is redirected to https://192.168.1.9/userSense and then back to the login page.
   - On the login page, check for:
     - "Authentication Failed for user:{username}"
     - "User is already logged in with same ip ..."
   - Treat these as failed login or already-logged-in (not a new success).
   - Detect successful login by checking if redirected to https://www.simulanis.com/ (driver.current_url).

2. Internet Connectivity Check
   - Before attempting login, check if the system has internet access (e.g., by reaching https://www.simulanis.com/ or https://google.com with a timeout).
   - If not connected, show a notification and do not attempt login.

3. Smarter Retry Logic (Optional)
   - If login fails due to no internet, do not retry immediately.
   - If login fails due to authentication, prompt the user to check credentials.
